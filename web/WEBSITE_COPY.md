## SECTION 2: RESULTS / CREDIBILITY
**Location:** `#results` section

**Section Headline (H2):**
Business Outcomes, Not Tool Deployments

**Section Description:**
We partner with service businesses, agencies, and revenue teams that need strategic AI infrastructure, not point solutions. Here's how systems architecture drives measurable business impact.

**Result Card 1:**

## SECTION 3: PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION
**Location:** `#problem` section

**Section Headline (H2):**
Revenue Leaks Compound When Systems Don't Connect.

**Section Description:**
Disconnected tools create bottlenecks. Manual processes limit scale. Data gaps slow decisions. We start with economics, not technology. Drivn.ai diagnoses operational inefficiencies, designs AI infrastructure that compounds, and implements systems architecture aligned to revenue goals.

**Problem Card 1:**
- **Title:** Disconnected Systems
- **Description:** Revenue systems operate in silos — leads leak between tools, data stays buried, and decision velocity slows.

**Problem Card 2:**
- **Title:** Operational Friction
- **Description:** Manual processes consume high-value time. Teams chase leads instead of creating leverage and scale.

**Problem Card 3:**
- **Title:** No Strategic AI Partner
- **Description:** Owners need advisors who understand business economics, not vendors selling point solutions.
